            Millenium Park <br><br>
            With 25 acres of Awe-Inspiring Landscape, breathtaking architecture and an iconic collection
             of public art, Millennium Park is Chicago's premier green space.
            Millennium Park sits on space that was previously occupied by rail yards and parking lots. 
            Through a massive civic effort, generous private donations and six years of tireless work, 
            the Park ceremoniously opened on July 16, 2004. 
            Today, 25-acre Millennium Park is the second most popular tourist attraction in
            Illinois (following close on the heels of Navy Pier), and contains some of the 
            greatest public art pieces in the world.

            Shedd Aquarium<br><br>
            <img src="images/att2.jpg" alt="Chicago bean" class = "att2">
            Shedd Aquarium was the first inland aquarium with a permanent saltwater fish collection. 
            Located on Lake Michigan, it is located on the Museum Campus Chicago, which it shares 
            with the Adler Planetarium and the Field Museum of Natural History.  It was the most visited
             aquarium in the U.S. in 2005, and in 2007, it surpassed the Field Museum as the most 
             popular cultural attraction in Chicago. The aquarium contains 1,500 species, including fish,
             marine mammals, birds, snakes, amphibians, and insects. 
             The wild reef exhibited at the Shedd Aquarium.
             In 2003 Shedd opened Wild Reef, a permanent exhibit located two levels below the main 
             building. The exhibit contains a total of 525,000 US gallons (1,990,000 l) and 
             recreates a Philippine coral reef on the Apo Island marine reserve, 
             complete with living coral, multiple species of fish and rays.
